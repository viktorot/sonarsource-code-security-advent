# SonarSource's Code Security Advent Calendar 2020

[SonarSource](https://twitter.com/SonarSource) has a really interesting code security advent planned for 2020. The basic idea is that they post a snippet of code that has some sort of a vulnerability. After, it is up to the participants to review the code and figure out where the problem lies.

While working through the challenges, I felt that just looking over the code is sometimes not enough to get a full grasp of some vulnerabilities, especially the more complex ones.

So, what I am going to be doing is try and make a simple application for each challenge that can be run locally. That way you have a small playground to test a working version of the vulnerable code, see how it all fits together and see that an attacker needs to do to make the app miss-behave.
