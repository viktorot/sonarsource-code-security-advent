# SonarSource's Code Security Advent Calendar 2020

[SonarSource](https://twitter.com/SonarSource) has a really intersting code security advent planned for 2020. The basic idea is that they post a snippet of code that has some soft of a vulnrabilitiy. After, it is up to the participants to review the code and figure out where the problem lies.

While working throught the challenges, I felt that just looking over the code is sometimes not enought to get a full grasp of some vulnrabiliities, especially the more complex ones.

So what I'm going to be doing is try and make a simple application for each challenge that can be run locally. That way you have a small playground to test a working version of the vulnrable code, see how it all fits together and see that an attacker needs to do in oreder to make the app miss-behave.
